In this assignment, you will design and implement a complete Tic-Tac-Toe State Verifier for a generalized 6x6 board using the SimpleRISC assembly language. 
Your program will be given a snapshot of a game state via memory and must determine whether the state is legal or illegal. If the state is legal, the program must further determine whether the game outcome is a win for Player 1, a win for Player 2, or a draw.

All inputs are provided before execution begins, and the program must produce a single deterministic output value.  
The assignment emphasizes low-level algorithm design, correctness reasoning, memory discipline, and exhaustive handling of edge cases under architectural constraints.

This assignment contributes 10% to the course total.
