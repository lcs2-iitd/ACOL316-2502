## INSTRUCTIONS

We are floating five problem statements for the course project of AIL861/ELL881/ELL8299.

- Please get in touch with the consulting TA corresponding to the project you choose for any help or assistance.
- Be honest in your work.
- You will be evaluated based on the rigor of your experiments and analysis; thus, analyze the cause even if you get negative results and report your findings.
- Remember that this course project holds the highest weightage (25%) in the grading of this course - please devote appropriate time to it. If you start the project towards the end of the semester and seek help from us, sorry, we will not be able to help you.
- Please do not copy any part of your report from online sources. If you refer to any source/paper, cite it appropriately. Any sort of plagiarism will be heavily penalized.
- Do not use any GenAI tool (like ChatGPT) to write your report. You will be penalized for it.
- You can, however, adapt or use code from any public GitHub repository. If you do, please mention and cite them in your report.
- The report must be written in the [ACL format (Overleaf Template)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj). Submit the non-anonymous version as a PDF with the names of group members.
- The GitHub Repository with all the source code must be shared with the corresponding consulting TA before the final submission deadline. The following are the GitHub usernames of the TAs:
    - Shashank Agarwal (`shanks733`)
    - Prottay Kumar Adhikary (`proadhikary`)
    - Aswini Kumar Padhi (`AswiniNLP`)
    - Anwoy Chatterjee (`C-anwoy`)
- If you are interested in doing a self-proposed project, please discuss your proposal with Prof. Tanmoy after the class or meet him in his office, or get formal approval by mailing him.
- Each project can be taken up by a maximum of 4 groups (each group can have up to 2 members), allotted on a first-come, first-served basis. Select your project quickly and fill in your details in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16jZugL5oHfOby2s1prWs9qLbGY7DvvOFv0zvrBT1gxo/edit?usp=sharing).
- Last but not least, enjoy the exploration in your project. Experiment with any idea you get. Think about the problem. All problems are of an exploratory nature - choose the one that aligns best with your interests.
